# Troubles

Check that the `INT` pin is wired.


## [ESP32-C3] I2C `TimeOut`

This happens with latest versions of `probe-rs`.

- the problem is [wont-fix](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/issues/2818#issuecomment-2358791448), unless they get news from Espressif

If you need to work on ESP32-C3, you can install commit `6fee4b6` of `probe-rs`. That should work, but you won't get updates to the tool.

## `VL53L5CX_Configuration` size dispute

>This *is* a bug of the build system, but happens rather rarely and the author hasn't been able to fix it. Please try! :)

```
$ cargo build --release --lib
   Compiling vl53l5cx_uld v0.0.0 (/home/ubuntu/ZOO.tof/tof/vl53l5cx_uld)
error[E0080]: evaluation of constant value failed
  --> src/uld_raw.rs:38:10
   |
38 |         [::core::mem::size_of::<VL53L5CX_Configuration>() - 2328usize];
   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ attempt to compute `2320_usize - 2328_usize`, which would overflow

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0080`.
```

The reason is something's gotten confused with the `tmp/config.h[.next]` files. Remove them, and retry the build:

```
$ rm tmp/config.h*
$ cargo build		# might be needed
$ make manual
$ make -f Makefile.dev m3
```

That should fix it.

```

The VL firmware tries to read `0x2c00` and doesn't get the values it wants.

Reason unknown.

Workaround: none??

**TO BE STUDIED**

**EDIT:**

Just relaunching seems to *sometimes* avoid this!
