# `v53l5cx_uld`

Turns the `VL53L5CX_ULD_API` source code into something that can be touched with Rust.

>Note: Usually Rust/C bindings are done in two layers: a `-sys` library forming a 1-to-1 bridging to C code, and another library adapting the use for Rust.
>
>We *kind of* have this approach, by having a a `src/uld_raw.rs` generated by `bindgen` from C sources. But these are in the one Rust module, not two separate.
>Currently, we are keeping everything together (for simplicity); depends on the amount of Rust adaptation.

**The one thing this level doesn't do is *be aware of Embassy* in any way (`async/.await`).**

## Pre-reading

- ["Using C Libraries in Rust"](https://medium.com/dwelo-r-d/using-c-libraries-in-rust-13961948c72a) (blog, Aug '19)

   A bit old, but relevant (C API's don't age!).
   
## The job

><font color=orange>*tbd. CHANGES TO THE IMAGE ARE LIKELY!*</font>


## Requirements

See hardware and software requirements -> [`../README`](../README.md).

<!--
```
$ clang -print-targets | grep riscv32
    riscv32     - 32-bit RISC-V
    riscv64     - 64-bit RISC-V
```
-->

## Preparation

Check `.cargo/config.toml` and `Cargo.toml` that any references to `target` or `chip` are correct.

>tbd. There's planned to be a `./set-target.sh` script that asks the chip type and verifies/changes these files, for you.


## Compiling 

```
$ cargo build --release --lib
```

The command uses `Makefile.inner` internally. You can also use it directly; have a look at its contents.

<span />

>Note: Somewhat unintuitively, the build doesn't have any Chip-specific features. No `esp32c3`-like. This is *either* because
>
>- a) the compilation (`clang`) is done using a single target that covers all ESP32 (RISC-V) chips: `riscv32`
>- b) the author hasn't really cracked it; such features *will* be needed!!
-->

## Running samples

```
$ cargo run --release --example _0-nada
```

```
$ cargo run --release --example _1-ranging_basic
```

|||
|---|---|
|`0-nada`|Just check the workflow; no sensor activity|
|`1-ranging_basic`|...|


*tbd. Hardware setup for those.*
