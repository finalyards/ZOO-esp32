# `v53l5cx_uld`

Turns the `VL53L5CX_ULD_API` source code into something that can be touched with Rust.

>Note: Usually Rust/C bindings are done in two layers: a `-sys` library forming a 1-to-1 bridging to C code, and another library adapting the use for Rust.
>
>We *kind of* have this approach, by having a a `src/uld_raw.rs` generated by `bindgen` from C sources. But these are in the one Rust module, not two separate.
>Currently, we are keeping everything together (for simplicity); depends on the amount of Rust adaptation.

**The one thing this level doesn't do is *be aware of Embassy* in any way (`async/.await`).**

## Pre-reading

- ["Using C Libraries in Rust"](https://medium.com/dwelo-r-d/using-c-libraries-in-rust-13961948c72a) (blog, Aug '19)

   A bit old, but relevant (C API's don't age!).

## Requirements

See hardware and software requirements -> [`../README`](../README.md).

## Preparation

The workflow has been tested on these MCUs:

|||
|---|---|
|`esp32c3` (default)|[ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitc-02.html) dev kit, with JTAG/USB wiring added|
|`esp32c6`|[ESP32-C6-DevKitM-01](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c6/esp32-c6-devkitm-1/user_guide.html)|

If you are using ESP32-C3, the repo is ready for use. To use ESP32-C6, run this once: `./set-target.sh` .

### Wiring

See [WIRING](./WIRING.md).

## Compiling 

```
$ cargo build --release
```

>The command uses `Makefile.inner` internally. If there are problems with the build, you may want to run the Makefile separately (see below). Also, have a look at its contents.
>
>```
>$ make -f Makefile.inner src/uld_raw.rs tmp/libvendor_uld.a
>```

## Running samples

```
$ cargo run --release --features=defmt --example nada
[...]

```

```
$ cargo run --release --features=defmt,distance_mm --example _1-ranging_basic
```

|||
|---|---|
|`nada`|Checks the build setup and `defmt` logging; no sensor activity|
|`_1-ranging_basic`|...|


*tbd. Hardware setup for those.*

## Troubleshooting

### General

Make sure you've installed `probe-rs` from GitHub. Stock version 0.24.0 is NOT FRESH ENOUGH!

### No log output (ESP32-C3 only)

```
$ probe-rs run --log-format '{L}_{s}' target/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf/release/examples/nada
      Erasing ✔ [00:00:03] [################] 192.00 KiB/192.00 KiB @ 57.05 KiB/s (eta 0s )
  Programming ✔ [00:00:18] [################] 22.54 KiB/22.54 KiB @ 1.25 KiB/s (eta 0s )    Finished in 18.072815s



```

The C3 board may needs a physical reset (and reattaching) prior to each run.

- keep both `RESET` and `BOOT` buttons pressed; release `RESET`
- release `BOOT`

This sets the device in "download mode".

- push the `RESET` button
- re-attach on USB/IP: e.g. `sudo attach -r 192.168.1.29 -b 3-1`
- try again
