# built-in

Exercising features that don't need any added hardware, in addition to an MCU.

- reading andlog signals
- internal temperature sensor
- ...

Note: For features in devkits (Boot button, RGB LED), see [`../devkit`](../devkit/README.md).

## Examples

<!-- #hidden
### `button`

```
$ cargo run --release --example button
```

Reading a button can be used for interactive prompting (since `semihosting` doesn't provide that on `probe-rs`).
