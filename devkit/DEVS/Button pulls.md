Considering whether an internal resistor should be applied, when reading the devkit BOOT button, some observations and a conclusion.

|Observations|
|---|
|There is no external resistor in *Figure 1*.|
|There is a capacitor, parallel to the button. This is nice, since it avoids debounce. ðŸ™‚|
|The button is not connecting when depressed.|

**Reasons for pulling `Down`**

- `esp_hal` sample does it (did it): [source](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/732c442c24adb9d1308aa6a9a838dd6a43f08e8d/examples/src/bin/wifi_ble.rs#L55-L61)

When NOT pushed, `GPIO9` would be in `GND`, emptying the `C13` capacitor.

When PUSHED, current would flow through the switch, and the internal resistor, between `GND` and `GND`. Thus, this cannot work. (but it does?)


**Reasons for pulling `Up`**

When NOT pushed, no current. `C13` fully loaded.

When PUSHED, current would flow from `GND`, through the internal resistor, to `Vcc`.


**Reasons for not pulling**

When NOT pushed, `GPIO9` would be hanging loose. That cannot be good.
