## Learning material (optional)

The Bluetooth Low Energy ecosystem is more complex than normal sensors would be. Thus, we want to offer a list of in-depth dive to the protocols.

- [Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy?view=all) (Adafruit; updated Mar'14)

	Simple introduction (maybe 5-10 min).

	>Note: The text has *some* inaccuracies, for example a Bluetooth Peripheral can be in connection with multiple Centrals, at the same time.

- [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/) (DevAcademy by Nordic Semiconductor)

	- 6 lessons
	- "8â€“10 hours to complete"
	- Exercises use Nordic hardware, but can also just be read through.

	Author opinion: *If you only plan to attend one course, this is a good one!*

You will be "living" on the "host" side of the HCI (Host/Client Interface). Most BLE devices (ESP32 included) have such an interface, even when the same chip would handle both roles. The interface is standardized, so essentially it means serializing/deserializing whatever goes on in BLE. The [`troubleÂ´](...) library takes care of this for you, but it's good to know what's under the hood...
