# Track

## `trouble` 0.1.0 release

- [crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=trouble)
- [0.1 Milestone](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble/milestone/1) (`embassy-rs/trouble` GitHub)

	`trouble` seems way more "early" than other libraries used in the `ZOO` repo. But.. we don't really have a option, wanting:
	
	- BLE host capabilities, for custom capabilities

	Let's track when `trouble` would reach its first real release - and if necessary/possible, try to push it past the line!!!
