Available from:

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403) (iOS)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) (Android)
- [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop) (Windows 64-bit, macOS, Linux - Ubuntu x86_64)

<!-- editor's note
Windows 32-bit version is only at 4.x; others 5.2. Thus, omitting from the list.

While the mobile apps use the device's own BLE circuitry, the nRF Connect for Desktop *"is designed to be used with [Nordic's] development kits and dongles"*. They start from less than 10 eur... `#wink`
