## Recommended training material (optional)

To learn more about the potential of BLE, check these:

- [Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy?view=all) (Adafruit; updated Mar'14)

	Simple introduction (maybe 5-10 min).

	>Note: The text has *some* inaccuracies, for example a Bluetooth Peripheral can be in connection with multiple Centrals, at the same time.

- [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/) (DevAcademy by Nordic Semiconductor)

	- 6 lessons
	- "8â€“10 hours to complete"
	- Exercises use Nordic hardware, but can also just be read through.

	Author opinion: *If you only plan to attend one course, this is a good one!*

## Next episode - Web 

Head over to [`../extras/ble-web-app`](../extras/ble-web-app/README.md) and you'll find a Web app that can interact with your BLE device!

Leave the device on, running the custom service. See you there! :)
